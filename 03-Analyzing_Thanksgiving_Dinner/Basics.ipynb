    "The main Thanksgiving dish is overwhelmingly turkey. The main side dish is mashed potatoes, followed by rolls/biscuits and green beans/green bean casserole. The main dessert is pumpkin pie, followed by apple pie and then pecan pie. Ice cream is the most common dessert that is not pie, likely because it goes with the pie.\n",

    "People are least likely to have Thanksgiving at their own home if their household income is \\$50,000 - \\$74,999 and are most likely to host Thanksgiving if their household income is \\$200,000 and up. The older a person is, the more likely they are to have Thanksgiving dinner in their own home, which probably correlates with their household income. Younger people and people in households with less money are more likely to have a \"Friendsgiving\"."
